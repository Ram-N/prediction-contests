# T20 Men's WC Prediction Contest Rules and Guidelines

### The Contest has 3 stages -- Group, Super-8 and Knockouts

- This contest is open to all.
- One entry per person please (Honor system)
- You are competing for glory. The winner will be the undisputed **T20 Worldcup Prediction Champion** for the next 4 years, until the next T20 World cup.
- The winner of each stage will make it to the [Prediction Hall of Fame](/prediction-contests/past/hof)



## T20 World Cup Format ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_ICC_Men%27s_T20_World_Cup)

- 20 national teams will be playing in the Group stage. There are a total of 4 groups of 5 countries each.
- The top 2 teams from each Group Stage proceed to the *Super 8* stage.


## Scoring Rules for the Prediction Contest

### Group Stage

You pick two teams per group, and for each one, you predict whether it will be the Group winner or the Group runner-up.  For each team you picked, you get 2 points if they advance from the group stage by landing in the exact position (winner/runner-up) you picked. You get 1 point if they advance to the next stage, but in the other position (winner/runner-up). You get 0 points if they don't advance from the group stage.

**Summary**
- 2 Points if you get the team and its position exactly correct.
- 1 point if you get the team right, but the rank is off. (Ex. You predicted Afghanistan will finish 2nd, but if Afghanistan finishes 1st - you get only one point.)
- 0 points if you pick a team that does not qualify in either of the top 2 spots
- The maximum possible score in the Group Stage is **16 points**. (2+2) x 4 groups


**Deadline: Group Stage Predictions close on May 31st**
(That is, before the 1st match starts. So please don't wait!)
