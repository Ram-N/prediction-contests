- You are competing for glory. The winner will be the undisputed **Worldcup Prediction Champion** for the next 4 years, until the next Cricket World cup.

## Scoring Rules for the Prediction Contest

### Group Stage
- You have to pick the 4 qualifying teams out of the 10 in the Group stage
- Extra points for getting each Qualifying team's Position (Rank) correct
- 4 Points if you get the team and its position exactly correct.
- 3 points if you are off by 1 position. (Ex. You predicted Afghanistan will finish 3rd, but if Afghanistan finished 2nd or 4th, you get 3 points.)
- 2 Points if you are off by 2 positions. If you predict a team will finish #1, but if it finishes #3, you get 2 points
- 1 point if you are off by 3 positions. If you predict a team will finish #4, but it ends up in the top spot, you get 1 point.
- 0 points if you pick a team that does not qualify in the top 4 spots
- The maximum possible score in the Group Stage is **16 points**. (4 x 4)

For example: There are 4 points for each qualifier identified correctly _in its correct ranking_. If you predict the 4th qualifying team as the #4 qualifier, you get 4 points. But if you predict that it will be #2, you only get 2 points. You lose one point for each position that you missed. 

### Semifinals
- 8 points for correctly picking a team that makes it to the Finals
- Please note that the top qualifier (#1) plays qualifier #4. And Qualifier #2 plays #3.
- You get full points if your pick wins. (Whether it is Semi1 or Semi2 doesn't matter.)
- The maximum score in the Semifinals is **16 points**. (8 x 2)

### Finals
- **16 points** for picking the overall champion correctly.

Maximum points that can be scored = 16 + 16 + 16 = **48 points**


### Leaderboard
The leaderboard will be updated regularly, once the Group stage nears its completion and some team places are known. Note that there is a separate leaderboard for participants who are Under-18.
The **Ultimate winner** will be declared on November 19th, 2023.

### Group Code
If a smaller subset of participants so wish, they could have a mini-leaderboard among themselves. This is possible if they all use a 
common agreed upon `Group Code`. For example, "Engg Club." It is even possible for one participant to be part of several groups:
Just enter each one as comma-separated. Example: Engg Club, Hikers

Each group will have its own leaderboard and a web-page, but everyone is part of the main leaderboard.
