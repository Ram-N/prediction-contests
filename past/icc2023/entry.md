### Group Code
In the form, there is one _optional_ field -- the Group Code.

If a smaller subset of participants so wish, they could have a mini-leaderboard among themselves. This is possible if they all use a 
common agreed upon `Group Code`. For example, `Engg Club` It is even possible for one participant to be part of several groups:
Just enter each one as comma-separated. Example: `Engg Club, Bay Hikers, CSK Fans`

Each group will have its own leaderboard and a web-page, but everyone is part of the main leaderboard.
