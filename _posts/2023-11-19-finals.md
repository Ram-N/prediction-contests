Oh well.


### Main Contest Winner

Back in early October only 8 of the 66 contestants picked Australia as the eventual winner. Let us give them their due credit: Keshav Narasimhan, Radhika, Ram Narasimhan, Rikhi Kaushal, Kausalya Santhanam, Sri Iyer, Kalyan M, Mukund, and Venkatesh. Since a whopping 16 points are given to this prediction, all these people end up around the top of the leaderboard.

**Keshav Narasimhan** (Pittsburgh, PA) scored an impressive 42 out of possible 48 points and is the sole winner. (Not sure if it is skill or luck or a combination, but Keshav was also the winner of the [ICC WC 2019 Prediction contest](http://localhost:4000/prediction-contests/past/icc2019/)! By scoring 40, Radhika finishes second. Rikhi K and Ram N. finish in 3rd place.

Well done, **Radhika, Rikhi and Ram**. And big congratulations, Keshav!

One possible way to make predictions in these contests is to simply pick based on the ODI rankings. Thanks to a last-match upset, our pre-tournament Rankings as well as the "Wisdom of the Crowd" entries only scored 18 and 15 points respectively. Did your picks do better than these automated rankings?

### Finals mini-contest winner

Congratulations **Chayan, Keshav, Kshitij, Mukund, and Sriram Venkatesh!** Well done on winning the finals mini-contest. Only 2 people (out of 48 contestants) picked _AUS-Comfort_ -- Kshitij (Richmond, VA) and Chayan (Bay Area). Chayan is also the author of [this article](https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests/2023/11/17/Chayan-Seizing-the-moments.html), which he wrote ahead of the Finals.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to **Mukund, Chayan, and Vivek Shenoy** for beta-testing the contest forms and suggesting several improvements along the way. Thanks to **D Sivakumar, Goutham, and Arvind Narayanan** for discussing the probability aspects, for helping make the questions and the points "fairer" and for helping reduce the role of luck in these contests.

Over 70 people participated in one or more of the ICC2023 prediction contests. Thanks especially to those of you who convinced other family members to play along. It was heartening (and amusing) to see how invested people become in these contests!

All of the winners of the ICC 2023 contests have now been inducted into the [Prediction Contest Hall of Fame](https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests/past/hof).

See you all at the next big one.
