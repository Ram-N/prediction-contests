## Interesting Observations

### Most Confident Picks

- **Harsh** went all-in with 100 confidence on every team!
- **Pankaj Tyagi** is almost as bold with 90+ confidence across the board
- **vivek** took a unique approach - extreme confidence (100) in 4 teams, minimal (1) in the other 4

### Team Favorites

Looking at average confidence scores:

- **Seahawks (SEA)** - Strong favorite with one participant ("Go Seahawks! Tees") giving 100 confidence
- **Buffalo (BUF)** - High confidence from multiple participants
- **49ers (SF)** and **Rams (LAR)** - NFC favorites with strong support

### Bold Strategies

- Several participants are playing it safe with balanced scores
- Others are taking aggressive stances on specific teams
- The scoring formula will reward those who correctly identified strong winners with high confidence
