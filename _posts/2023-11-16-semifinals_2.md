# Update #9 - Finals mini-contest, and Semifinals Contest winners



### The Finals mini-contest is now open!
At least 3 people missed joining the semifinals contest because they weren't sure when it would close. Remember, all contests close when the first ball is bowled. Don't wait until Sunday for this one. It only takes 1 minute. (Okay, a few minutes if you do some "research")

### Semifinals Contest Winners
It is a five-way tie for the top spot. All 5 winners scored 14 points, but what's interesting is that no two of them had the same set of predictions. See the table below. Congratulations, **Aakarsh, Kshitij, Santhanam, Radhika and Sreenivas.** Well done, take a bow!

### Main Contest Update

The Prediction Scores have been updated after both the semifinal matches. After several weeks of being the table leader, **Sackett** has been unseated. (He picked SA as a semifinal winner.) **Kshitij (Richmond, VA)** leads with 27 points, and **Bharath (Bangalore)** is just one point behind him. However, if AUS does win on Sunday (breaking 1.5 billion hearts if they do), then **Keshav N (Pittsburgh)** will be the sole winner.

There are still 16 points up for grabs -- Remember that 68% of all predictors have picked India, and 14% have predicted Australia.

Here are the current leaders...
