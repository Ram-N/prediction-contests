### NFL 2023 Predictions Contest Launched

This was very much a last-minute thing. So we didn't publicize it much. That is also why the first 4 Wild Card games are not being counted, since the entry is open up until the Bills-Steelers starts.

Check your score here: [https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests/nfl2023/leaderboard](https://ram-n.github.io/prediction-contests/nfl2023/leaderboard)

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to **D Sivakumar** for designing the entire contest. He is the one who came up with the idea to Rank-Order the teams once, and suggest "Cross-Entropy" as the loss function. (penalty). Thanks also to **Kshitij Agrawal** who got a few of his Fantasy Football team members to join in the fun.
